## What is The ANTS?

**The ANTS** is an organisation focused on IGCSE, A Level tutoring and CCA activities for Myanmar students pursuing international qualifications. Our platform is a curriculum-focused productivity and learning ecosystem wired directly into exam board criteria — so your timetables, flashcards, and grade calculators understand the difference between a CAIE IGCSE and an Edexcel IAL.

Whether you're targeting A* in IGCSE or A Levels, IELTS band 7+, or an OSSD diploma, The ANTS keeps your study life organised in one place — and connects you with a vibrant community of learners and contributors.
